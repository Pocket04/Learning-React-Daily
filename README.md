# Learning-React-Daily
I have a bit of experience with Java, no work opportunities though. I decided to learn JS, and now I am learning react, now after 1-2 projects, I am completely lost with a bunch of the concepts, I am going to fast forward in the beginning, but my idea is to learn react by practicing 1 concept a day.
